The Non-Medical Adverse Questionnaire is intended to create a Non-Medical Adverse Event Report to the sIRB.  An example of a Non-Medical Adverse Event is the inadvertent disclosure to several participants that they are receiving the placebo in a blind study.  The Non-Medical Adverse Questionnaire captures details for the report such as the root cause of the event, the corrective action plan and associated changes to the protocol or consent form as a result of the event.
